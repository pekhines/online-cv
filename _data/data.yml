    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      In the dynamic field of data science and artificial intelligence, 
      I have special interest particularly on **industrial AI** and model **explainability** in recent years.
      My journey began at Mondragon Unibertsitea, where I graduated in **telecommunications engineering** in 2009.
      Further nurturing my passion for technology and innovation, I pursued a **PhD** at the
      Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), specializing in civil engineering knowledge.
      In 2014, I successfully defended my thesis titled "Design and validation of a methodology for
      wind energy structures health monitoring", a significant contribution to the field of **Condition Monitoring**.  
      In Ikerlan S.Coop, I was part of the Sensor Department, spearheading projects within the ETICS line. 
      My role evolved over time, and by December 2015, I transitioned to the Mechanics Department. 
      Here, I was  developing projects centered around data analysis 
      for monitoring the condition of machinery parts. My stay at Ikerlan culminated in the Control
      and Monitoring Department, where I tackled complex projects involving monitoring and data analysis 
      in advanced manufacturing problems until 2017. In 2017, I embraced a new opportunity to further my 
      research and development skills at the Research Group of Intelligent Systems for Industrial Systems
      of Mondragon Unibertsitea. In this role, I have been at the forefront of designing, developing, and
      implementing projects that resonate with the Big Data paradigm and anomaly detection. My expertise
      in data analysis has been pivotal in addressing various industrial system challenges. As I continue
      to forge ahead in my career, my primary focus has shifted towards industrial AI and model explainability. 
      This niche area allows me to delve deeper into the intricacies of artificial intelligence, fostering 
      innovation and efficiency in the industrial sector. My commitment to excellence and continuous learning propels 
      me to explore new frontiers, contributing to the advancement of technology and knowledge in the industry.
      
education:
    title: Education
    info:
      - degree: PhD in Civil Engineering
        university: Universidad Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC)
        time: 2009 - 2014
        details: |
          TITLE: "Design and validation of a methodology for wind energy structures health monitoring"; 
          The Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system, enhanced with AI and statistical learning, aims to
          optimize the performance and reduce maintenance costs of structures by accurately assessing their current state. 
          Utilizing a network of sensors attached to the structure, it continuously monitors various 
          parameters, employing proprietary algorithms for precise analysis. This advanced approach 
          integrates AI to facilitate pattern recognition, comparing current data with baseline statistics
          to identify potential damages. Moreover, statistical learning aids in the efficient processing 
          of accelerometer data, fostering a robust methodology for damage detection that considers 
          environmental and operational conditions. This comprehensive strategy ensures not only 
          the integrity of the structure but also the functionality of the sensors, making it a pivotal
          tool in maintaining the health and longevity of structures like wind turbines, adapting
          to unpredictable factors like wind and sea waves.
